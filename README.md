# SNAKE_GAME
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and the Tkinter library. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen to eat food, and with each piece of food consumed, the snake grows longer. The goal is to avoid crashing into the walls or the snake's own body.
